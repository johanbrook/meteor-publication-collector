# Publication Collector

[![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector.svg?maxAge=2592000)]()

This package makes testing publications in Meteor easier and nicer.

Instead of resorting to exporting or exposing your publication functions for doing testing, this package lets you "subscribe" to a given publication and assert its returned results.

## Installation

```
meteor add johanbrook:publication-collector
```

## Usage

This package is server-only and can't be imported on the client.

```js
// server/myPublication.test.js

import { PublicationCollector } from "meteor/johanbrook:publication-collector";

describe("myPublication", function () {
  it("should publish 10 documents", function (done) {
    const collector = new PublicationCollector({ userId: Random.id() });

    collector.collect(
      "myPublication",
      firstPublicationArg,
      secondPublicationArg,
      (collections) => {
        assert.equal(collections.myCollection.length, 10);
        done();
      }
    );
  });
});
```

### PublicationCollector

```js
const collector = new PublicationCollector(opts);
```

`opts` may have the following attributes:

- `userId`: Add a `this.userId` to the publication's context
- `delayInMs`: By default, `collect` callbacks are called when the publication is ready. If you use this option, the callbacks will be called `delayInMs` milliseconds after the publication is ready.

An instance of `PublicationCollector` also is an `EventEmitter`, and emits a `ready` event when the publication is marked as ready.

### PublicationCollector.collect -> Promise

```js
collector.collect(publicationName, [publicationArgs..., callback]);
```

- `publicationName (String)`: the name of the publication (String)
- `publicationArgs`: zero or more arguments to the publication
- `callback (Function)`: Optional. The function to be called when the publication is ready. Will be called with a `collections` object.

Returns a Promise which resolves to a `collections` object.

The `collections` value is an object containing key:value pairs where the key is the name of a collection that the publication published and the value is an array of the documents that were published in that collection.

```js
collector.collect(
  "myPublication",
  firstPublicationArg,
  secondPublicationArg,
  (collections) => {
    assert.equal(collections.myCollection.length, 10);
  }
);
```

or use Promises:

```js
const collector = new PublicationCollector();

collector.collect('myPublication')
  .then(collections => {
    // assertions..
  })
  .catch(ex => /* error handling */);

// Or async/await style
const collections = await collector.collect('myPublication');
// assertions..
```

## Development

```
npm install
```

Follow `.eslintrc`

### Tests

Run tests once with

```
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode (in console) with

```
npm run test:dev
```

## History

This project was originally a part of MDG's [Todos](https://github.com/meteor/todos) example Meteor app, but later extracted as a separate test package.

Based on https://github.com/stubailo/meteor-rest/blob/devel/packages/rest/http-subscription.js.

## Releases

- `1.2.0`
  - Add support for async publication
- `1.1.0`
  - Pin versions to Meteor@>=1.3.
  - Throw error when there's no publication for the provided name.
  - Upgrade dependencies.
    Â - Add support for Promises in the `.collect()` method. **Note:** This breaks tests that rely on errors being thrown in the `collect()` method (see [#36](https://github.com/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector/issues/36)).
- `1.0.10` - Always stop the publication when an error is thrown in the PublicationCollector callback. Thanks @SimonSimCity !
- `1.0.9` - Fix bug in 1.0.8 regarding empty array return. Thanks @nkahnfr !
- `1.0.8` - Fix support for publications returning nothing (an empty array). Thanks @ziedmahdi !
- `1.0.7` - Fix compatibility with `peerlibrary:reactive-publish`'s `_isDeactivated` function in publications ([#20](https://github.com/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector/pull/23), thanks @jaskinn!).
- `1.0.6` - Fix an issue with "ready" event being emitted more than once ([#16](https://github.com/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector/pull/16)). Thanks @nkahnfr!
- `1.0.5` - Fix an issue when publish handlers are using default arguments ([#15](https://github.com/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector/pull/15)). Thanks @dmihal!
- `1.0.4` - Don't try to operate on a document that doesn't exist in `changed` callback. Thanks @zenweasel, from [#13](https://github.com/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector/pull/13)!
- `1.0.3` - Fix compatibility with `peerlibrary:reactive-publish` package (bug #3), fixed in [#10](https://github.com/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector/pull/10). Thanks [@hexsprite](https://github.com/hexsprite)!
- `1.0.2` - Fix bug where `ready()` wasn't called if there were no results from a publication handler.
- `1.0.1`
  - Fixes inconsistent results from publication collector (thanks @PhilippSpo in [#2](https://github.com/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector/issues/2)).
  - Return an empty array if there are no returned documents from a publication ([#5](https://github.com/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector/issues/5)).
  - Accept `Mongo.ObjectID` as `_id` attribute ([#8](https://github.com/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector/issues/8)).
- `1.0.0` - First public release.

## To do

- [x] Make tests pass.
- [x] More docs.
- [ ] Support Promises.
